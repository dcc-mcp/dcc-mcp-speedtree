# Official SpeedTree capabilities

Use speedtree-discovery for installed content and preset inspection, and
speedtree-export for the official standalone CLI. CLI exports do not require
an attached GUI. They preserve input identity and produce an asset manifest
for target adapter import/readback. Live in-process generator edits and queries
remain unavailable until a supported vendor integration is implemented.

Before UI observation or input, report provider=dcc-cua, runtime version,
exact PID and HWND. Use only the project ui-control route with fresh binding.
Do not fall back to generic computer use or undocumented process injection.
Licensing and plugin changes require the corresponding operator workflow.
